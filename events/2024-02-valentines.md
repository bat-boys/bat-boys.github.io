The Efiilas, Feldspar, and Syggax members are all a little down, having spent
yet another season away from their home. For this week, including both
weekends, you can visit their morale officers and help out with their own
unique list of tasks to help them out.

Points are for the _event_ not the _faction_ so feel free to mix/match any
group's tasks you want. The morale officers also have a list of some example
prizes and their point costs.
