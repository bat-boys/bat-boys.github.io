# Trick or treat

The event is divided into three parts: daily activities, creating new eq, and
boss fights.

Daily activities start at this plaque, using 'tot start'. You will be assigned
a list of things to do this boot, many of which involve killing monsters,
exploring areas, and guild actions. Your goal is to get five of them in a
single day. It doesn't matter which five, and doing more won't carry over.
Your list of daily activities is tracked with 'show effects'.

*NOTE* In the description, 'matching monsters' is an abbreviation for
'monsters that count as targets for your daily kill task'. Using the requested
skills/spells/actions in combat can get you to your five activities faster.

For this event, you can also get points for obtaining new eq with the
'classic' stats on them (str, int, spr, dam, etc. but not skills, spells,
resists, or specials). You can register any piece of eq that is named by you,
held by you, and created in the last _three_ days. A piece of eq that is
registered is not changed or damaged, and multiple people can register the
same piece. However, you will need to register a piece of eq suitable for a
character your level -- newbies need slightly, midbies need moderately, and
highbies need greatly.

Bosses will mostly be a weekend event. The details of their spawning and
slaying will be something for you to figure out. As with many other events,
credit for Trick or Treat bosses will be shared between players and parties
who put in the effort (trebuchets sold separately).

During the event, mini-areas will appear in random overworld locations. Follow
the smoke of their bonfires to track them down. These mini-areas may contain
monsters and items that make completing your daily activities, but they will
not be mandatory. If you can't find any, use your BatMUD knowledge and ask
your fellow mortals for the targets you need.

The first time you complete each category -- the first day you get five
activities, the first eq stat you register, the first boss you kill -- will
get you 5 Event Points. Each after that will get 1 more. This should make it
easy to get started, but require more effort to max out your points.

This event will reset at the end of the first week. All points you have will
be locked, and you will restart the second week fresh. Points from both weeks
stack. The reason for this is mostly bugtesting. But, this has a side-effect
that 'first' can happen twice: once in the first week, once in the second.

Report bugs and ideas to me, and above all, have fun!

Okay, now that things seem more or less in order, this week we'll have the
Trick or Treat Event run at full points. 

Here are the rules:
1) There's an event room west of Arelium where you can start your part in the
Event. Just follow the smoke.

2) One of the three things you can do, every day, is a set of daily
activities, a mix of general activities (such as killing monsters and donating
items in the event room) and guild activities (which are based on the guild,
not your guild level, so it is not just possible but expected that a player
with only 1 level in a guild can get a task for that guild they can't do, yes
that is intentional, if you can't do it just ignore it). The goal is to do
five of your tasks in any one day. These tasks autosave when you complete one
of them, but you may need to return to the event room to start them again if
you quit out. Activities you can complete are in "show effects".
3) You can also, in the event room, "register" eq you have earned with your
name on it in the last three days. Each of the classic stats (such as str,
hpr, or avoid) counts, but only if the item is strong enough compared to your
character power. Note that multislot eq power is dilluted, so for example, a
full plate with +10 str is not all that strong since it has like 15 slots.
Each stat you contribute counts towards the event, and the item is not damaged
or used up -- everyone whose name is on it can register it.
4) During these events, more smoke will rise from mini-areas with, what a
coincidence, monsters you're likely tasked with killing and candy you're
likely tasked with looting. Follow the smoke to find them, too.
5) During the weekend, powerful bosses can be summoned in these mini-areas.
You'll need the correct colour of candles to do it. On weekdays, these nosave
candles are basically tiny weak torches and can be ignored, but you can make a
note of which creatures have which colour candle for later use. 

Each of the three things you need to do -- activities, eq, and bosses --
counts separately for event points. You get 10 points for the first of each
you do, and 1 more point for each after that. Right now there is no way to
track your current points except your own records, but I'll likely add it in
the next couple of days. 

Prizes can be purchased when the event is over. Yes, you can see them at the
event room, there's some up now and more will be added. The customizable eq
are the 10-point items at the top of the list with weak/no bonuses, and the
10-point scrolls that let you add stronger bonuses, up to twice. So, a
maxxed-out item will cost you 30 points, which if you've been testing the
event, you will find much easier to get. The maximum possible point total is
87 so you can get two maxxed-out items, not three. This is in addition to any
eq you get from boss kills, which is not tradable.
