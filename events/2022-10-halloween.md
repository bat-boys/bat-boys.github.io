## Gathering points

Key commands in the event room:
- `la circle`
- `talk to <npc in the room>`
- `contribute <item>`
- `activate ritual circle`
- `give ember to <npc in the room>`

Each camp's ritual circle requires 30 points to activate the circle and summon the
elemental. Each player can activate each camp's circle once per boot.

| Camp                  | Ingredient                                                   |
|-----------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| Efiilas / Lucentium   | herbs (plant lore). fresh: 2pt / herb, non-fresh: 1pt / herb |
| Syggax / Rothikgen    | raw meat (butchering), organs                                |
| Feldspar / Desolathya | skins (skinning), materials                                  |

You can check the current status of competing factions by talking to the npc.
Prizes from winning faction are permanent, others last for a year.

A good place to get ingredients is Lost Vale in Furnachia (210x, 440y)

## Elementals

Activating the ritual circle will echo the location of the elemental. It is always
in Furnachia, can be outworld or inside areas. It wanders, so hurry.

Killing the summoned elemental and returning the looted ember will give you
points to towards the specific camp.

Boss size varies based on who has done the activation.

Bosses have specials based on their adjectives:

| adjective  | effect |
|------------|--------|
| blasting   | |
| casting    | |
| combusting | It lights players on fire, players to damage to each others, especially on death.<br/>`Medium palotuline elemental raises a burning hand.`<br/>`Siggy blazes in flames, burning you!`<br/>`Sebaot's corpse is collected by Death, clad in black.`<br/>`Sebaot bursts into flames, filling the room!`<br/>`That really HURT!`|
| erupting   | Area damage<br/>`A torrent of flames roars out of Medium palotuline elemental's fingertips!` |
| ghostly    | It is `(undead)` |
| hulking    | It has a lot of hp |
| immolating | `A patch of flame ignites, burning the room!`<br/>`patch of blazing flames (glowing)`<br/>`The flames burn you!` |

This weekend, we're giving the upcoming event's point-getting mechanic a test
fire.

So how does the Event work?

1) Each of the three factions' main camp now has an extra room with a special
ritual you can perform. Activating the ritual will require plants for Efiilas,
skins and refined materials for Feldspar, and raw meat and organs for Syggax.
You'll need to collect 30 points worth, but, some items (fresh plants, better
materials, higher-quality organs) count more than others. Players with plant
lore, mining, skinning, etc. will find their skills highly prized during the
event, as these items can be freely traded.

2) If you don't like the idea of working with other players, there are other
sources for these items. In addition to any plants or materials you find in
existing areas, the Lost Vale that just opened has its own list. Special note,
items from older areas (most notably Digga's newbie area) could be
incompatible with the event.

3) If even that's not what you're looking for, the extra tasks on the message
boards on the factions' remote camps can be used. During the event, instead of
+10 Favor, completing a task will instead add +10 items you need to that
faction's ritual circle.

   In other words, every player has the ability to get 30 points and activate the
ritual. You just need to decide for yourself how you're going to do it.

4) Once you get the required 30 points for the ritual, you can activate the
ritual and locate a special event monster carrying a special event item. These
monsters will be in Furnachia, have strength based on your character's level
of power (higher-level players will create higher-level enemies) and most
importantly are _timed_. Do not activate the ritual unless you're ready to
sprint to Furnachia and hunt your target down. Kill the monster, get the item
it carries with your name on it, and you can get some event points.

   Each player may activate each faction's ritual once per boot. So, that's
three, tops. The elementals are strong enough that bringing a party is
recommended, but exceptionally strong players might be able to solo them.

5) The _second_ part of the event is, the factions you're helping are getting
points, too. The quest items held by the monsters can be turned in to any of
the three factions, even if it's not the faction whose ritual you just used.
You could, for example, get 30 plants, activate the Efiilas ritual, then give
the item to the Feldspar.

   Which faction gets how many points is a big part of the event, when it's run
for real. For one, you spend your event points faction by faction. For two,
the faction that ends with the most event points will get a permanent upgrade
-- a second set of daily tasks which opens up additional items from that
faction.

   Basically, the three factions are vying for access to Furnachia. You,
collectively, will decide which faction, or factions, gets that access. The
event will be temporary but its results will be permanent.

6) While tracking down the monsters with the rituals is the single best source
of event points, there will be others. Smaller items worth fewer points will
also appear in various places, mostly Furnachia. Unlike the monster-held
items, these items will not be named, and can be freely traded. Do not expect
them to be common.

So this weekend, gather up the items required to summon a monster or three and
see what the event has in store for you. And of course, report bugs to me as
you find them.

So first, the launch date will be Monday, Oct 24, and it will run for two
weeks. I have guests this weekend, and will not run the event while I'm not
around to babysit it for bugs on its first few days.

You've already seen the basic idea: gather natural ingredients (plants, meat,
skins, materials) for the three factions' ritual circles, locate an elemental,
track it down and kill it, then turn its ember in for event points for that
faction. Nothing about that is changing, but I'm going to tune the elementals
down a little bit. They're not meant to be soloable (at least not easily), but
the time drain was a little higher than I was going for. Simply put, a 3-man
party doing each of their 3 will take a while, true, but if it requires a
5-man the time for everyone to get all their embers starts to drag too much.

The points you get will stack throughout the event, and at the end can be
cashed in for prizes. There are going to be a _lot_ of prize options, because
most of them are set items. Each faction has three or four sets of 10 pieces
(torso, head, both arms, both legs, both hands, both feet, cloak, ring, belt,
and either bracelets or neck). Each item in the same set has the same bonuses.
At max level, it will be +greatly to one stat, +slightly to another stat, and
+slightly to each of two different skills. Wearing more items from the same
set will boost the skills, up to a maximum of +greatly in both. This means you
could potentially stack skills to a high enough percent that even UHB players
will notice the difference in game. As a further bonus, the item's +greatly
stat will also improve any Chaos Cauldron bonus you get to that same stat.

Example sets include:
- the Efiilas nobility plate, +greatly con +slightly str +slightly->greatly
  leadership and parry
- the Feldspar messenger outfit, +greatly dex +slightly wis +slightly->greatly
  songcasting and battle cadence
- the Syggax terror plate, +greatly str +slightly wis +slightly->greatly
  enhance criticals and tumbling attack

Other prizes include:
- an Efiilas stove that has a chance to add tick to any meal that doesn't
  have tick
- an Efiilas spellbook of the druid spell phoenix flames, which is
  runic heal + deaths door
- a Feldspar portabox, a 100-slot mineral box that can summon a professional
  forge once/hour
- a Feldspar skillbook of a pair of alchemist skills that let you create and
  throw firebombs
- a Syggax spellbook of demonfire, a single-target fire damage spell that
  uses cast demonology
- a Syggax spellbook of vampiric flames, a single-target fire damage mage
  spell that can heal the caster

There are so many prizes, it will be _impossible_ to get enough embers to buy
them all.

This is where the faction part comes in. At the end of the Event, whichever
faction has the most Event points from player turnins will permanently get
access to the Lost Vale and permanently add a separate list of tasks involving
them. These separate tasks award a separate "favor" that can be used to buy
and upgrade the same list of prizes. This also means, the winning faction,
_their prizes are permanent_. All of the others last the usual one year before
dropping to newbie quality (and being impossible to upgrade, since the items
to upgrade those prizes won't be available to the losing factions).

Even if none of the prizes turn out to be what you're looking for, the faction
that wins (or factions, if it's a tie) will keep that permanent upgrade and
increase their influence, in Furnachia and in general. How the balance of
power ends will be collectively up to you.

Okay, so the event prizes are more or less done at this point. I might add
more if I hear a particularly good suggestion, especially a pcity item (like a
forge or stove).

A few 'final' notes:

1) The prices are very likely going to be 200 embers for each piece of set eq,
regardless of slot. That means, if you get one ember each day during both
weekends, you'll end up with one piece of eq. If you get literally every
single ember literally every single day for the entire run of the event, and
give them all to the same faction, you could technically buy an entire set.
But I'm pretty sure nobody is going to do that.

   Remember that the items' identify info is available on the prize boards. You
won't have to guess what the stats are, and the stats are never random.

   Non-eq prizes will be 100 to 500, with the spellbooks/skillbooks being 500.
Skills, spells, and special effects of items from the non-winning factions
will be turned off after a year. For example, the Efiilas flint and steel will
still be a flint and steel, but will stop granting cold resist. Spells/skills
from the books will work like the existing ones, for example, if you read the
"vampiric flames" spellbook, you'll get the spell% at the same as your meteor
blast%. Of special note, the bard spell "bonfire tune" will share a KBH with
campfire tune. Thanks to Amarth for his help with that spell!

2) Consumables will also be available as point dumps. Not listed: chocolate.
You will be able to spend embers on chocolate, I'm just not listed it as a
prize since you won't be able to buy it _after_ the Event ends. All three
factions will offer chocolate.

3) Against the idea of the event, and against my better judgement, starting
this weekend I will allow you to summon smaller elementals designed to be
soloed. They will still be based on how strong you are, still drop named
embers only you can turn in, will spawn in easier locations, but only be worth
10 points not 50. Since you can still only summon one elemental per faction
per day, you should ONLY summon a solo elemental if you know for a fact you're
not going to get a party for a large one.

   If you spend every day from here on out only spawning solo elementals, you
will still be able to contribute some points to the faction(s) of your choice,
and maybe get a single piece of eq or some consumables for your efforts. The
idea for the event was about working together towards a goal, and yes, the
dramatic drop in points for solo work is intentional. I still strongly
recommend working with a team, but if you can't or won't, at least 10 points
is more than 0 points.

   Or, you could farm small embers, or buy/trade them from other players. They're
not going away.

With the elementals no longer spawning, the results are in -- surprising
probably nobody, the result is a tie between the Efiilas and the Syggax. They
both beat the Feldspar by a vast gulf, but came within 1% of each other.

In the next few days, I should have all three factions' prizes available for
purchase. If you have any remaining small embers, you will be able to turn
them in for a few more points. Also, I'll set up the special set of Furnachia
daily tasks for both factions, which you will pick up and return from the Lost
Vale (as several of the tasks will be centered on that area).

I hope everyone enjoyed themselves participating. Who knows, maybe something
like this will happen in a future April/October.

If you return to the rooms where you used to donate items and spawn
elementals, you should see some familiar faces now capable of selling Event
prizes.

Due to the nature of this Event, refunds are not being offered. Therefore you
are strongly encouraged to 'list' and 'view' before making your purchase,
especially with the Feldspar, since you'll never see those items again.

If, for whatever reason, you still have embers left, you should be able to
turn them in to those same people. It will, of course, not affect the Event
standing, but you will still get the points for them added to your score.

Semi-related note, the tasks boards at the branch camps are back to giving +10
Favor (max 2000) as they did pre-Event.
