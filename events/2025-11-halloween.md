The Harvest Event begins today and runs for the next two weeks, making the
last day Sun Nov 16. Here's how it works:

1) Every hour on the hour, an activity appears in the outworld. These
activities will vary in nature, but almost all will involve combat. Combat
parts are based around several small parties, rather than one large one. Kill
credit is shared, and monsters should tell you if you will get credit.

2) Each activity will have activity completion and personal completion, which
you can check on the X on the map. Personal completion varies by activity, but
combat pretty much always counts.

If the activity completes successfully, everyone wit personal completion
("major contributor") will get Harvest Event points and better rewards. If the
activity ends unsuccessfully, major contributors will get smaller rewards, but
nobody gets any points.

3) Getting major contribution to a successful activity is +5 points. However,
the first one per reboot is worth +20 points. There are other ways to get
Event points, such as completing activities on weekends, or donating at
Trilloch's construction site.

4) Prizes are still being coded, but the usual eq - customizable +greatly
points, meaning doing four activities (say, the weekends) will get you one.
The second will cost 200 more and the third 300 more, so maxxing out the Event
will require 4 activities/day every day plus some bonus points.

5) The event room is Ugly Joe's Kitchen in Arelium. There, you can look at the
schedule of that boot's activities in order, so you can pick your favorite and
plan ahead. When the next activity starts, a portal will open up to take you
to that activity, but you'll need to find your own way back.

I'll keep an eye on things and tune as we go.
