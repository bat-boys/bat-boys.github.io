For years, the Fox Hunt Master has been satisfied with his standard
quarry...but had dreamed of something more. Finally, after massive effort,
he's managed to secure twenty-five famous mythical creatures, and is testing
the hunters of BatMUD with a far greater challenge than a small doglike
creature. Everything from the timid, elusive wolpertinger to the Mongolian
Death Worm are being released into the world...

...and The Hunt Is On.

Each reboot, special blinking beacons will be placed at random places around
the outworld, spread throughout the continents. Each beacon will attract one
creature, 25 in total. Your jobs are as follows:

1. acquire a camera and take pictures of these creatures, and save these
   pictures in your album. At the end of the event, bring your album to the Fox
   Hunt Master to be awarded consumable prizes.
2. acquire a trophy case, kill the creatures, collect trophies from the kills,
   and display them in your trophy case. Trophy casaes are pcity items. At the
   end of the event, kills will translate into eq prizes.

The Hunt Is On will run through/including Sunday, Nov 3. You only need one
copy of each photograph, and one trophy from each kill. Multiple cases/albums
will not add extra results, so, once you get all 25, there's no benefit for
getting more of the same. 

Books containing the location of the beacons are spread out in various areas
throughout the game. Look for rooms with bookshelves and bookcases. Hunting
targets themselves should not be found in areas, only outside.

Multiple players/parties can tag the same monster for the same kill. Look for
a ** on the monster's description to know if you get credit for the kill or
not. It's possible for very strong players to one-shot weaker monsters before
getting credit, either wait for a repop or waith for the **. You don't need to
be in the room for the kill (in case it's an entry kill or you're dead).

Prizes include:
- 5+ photos: a hunter's cache pcity item that creates cooking ingredients over
  24 hours. More photos adds more cooking ingredients, which include fresh
  seafood and fresh edible plants.
- 5+ kills: your trophy case adds a small +stat boost that lasts all day.
- 15+ kills: the Gold Hunt Prize, an armour (your choice of rig, amulet, held or
  belt) with your choice of stat (str/int/wis/dex/con/cha/hpr/spr) and your
  choice of skill/spell (you must have spent XP on it and have it from 20% to
  90%) that scales with level up to +greatly.
- 20+ kills: the Fox's Fang, an upgraded Anyweapon whose base hit/damage stats
  continue to increase as you use it to fight more and more types of enemies
  over the coming year. Also adds +attack, +parry, +cast generic and +quick
  chant. Maxxing out the Fox's Fang will give a result that compares favorably
  to any existing weapon in the game, but of course, will not happen overnight.
- 25+ kills: the Burning Hunt Prize, which is similar to the Gold Hunt Prize,
  except it can also be a ring/neck, it scales up to +divinely, it adds two
  stats (but one is at half power), and the 90% train/study max is removed.

Prizes are not choices. If you get 20 kills, for example, you get the trophy
case bonus, and the Gold Hunt Prize, and the Fox's Fang. Plus whatever you get
for your album.

Merchants can make cameras, and alchemists can make film, in their respective
guilds. Better merchants can make lighter cameras. Better alchemists make more
film per attempt.

Coding for the Halloween 2024 Event is underway. I'm withholding details for
now, but I figured some people are going to ask how to plan around it, so I'll
give you info on that.

1. The event is based around activity by individuals and small parties.
   Highbies should not need to 9man to complete the event.
2. You will be able to participate on your own schedule. You can get just as
   many Event points at 0500 as 1700.
3. Sharing information will be the best way for the most players to complete
   the Event. Fortunately, there's a channel for that.
4. Monster kills credit will be shared through all players who put in the
   required amount of effort, even if they're not in the same room. You will have
   to be online, duh. You will know if a monster will give you credit if its name
   changes from Monster to **Monster in the room desc.
5. Prizes will again be split between one-year owned eq and consumables.
6. It will run for two weeks. Completing the Event will, as per usual, be
   easier to do if you play more, because that's how games work.
7. And this is the new one: if you want to get the best prizes this time,
   you're going to need a pcity room of your own. Simply put, not only does the
   event require an item that saves over reboots, but some of the prizes are
   designed to work that way, too. If you don't have a pcity room, or don't want
   to use one for the event, chesting will work, but it will be clumsy.
