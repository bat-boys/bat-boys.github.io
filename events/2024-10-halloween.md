Coding for the Halloween 2024 Event is underway. I'm withholding details for
now, but I figured some people are going to ask how to plan around it, so I'll
give you info on that.

1. The event is based around activity by individuals and small parties.
   Highbies should not need to 9man to complete the event.
2. You will be able to participate on your own schedule. You can get just as
   many Event points at 0500 as 1700.
3. Sharing information will be the best way for the most players to complete
   the Event. Fortunately, there's a channel for that.
4. Monster kills credit will be shared through all players who put in the
   required amount of effort, even if they're not in the same room. You will have
   to be online, duh. You will know if a monster will give you credit if its name
   changes from Monster to **Monster in the room desc.
5. Prizes will again be split between one-year owned eq and consumables.
6. It will run for two weeks. Completing the Event will, as per usual, be
   easier to do if you play more, because that's how games work.
7. And this is the new one: if you want to get the best prizes this time,
   you're going to need a pcity room of your own. Simply put, not only does the
   event require an item that saves over reboots, but some of the prizes are
   designed to work that way, too. If you don't have a pcity room, or don't want
   to use one for the event, chesting will work, but it will be clumsy.
